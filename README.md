# App Title

iCard

By Team iCard.

## Description

Sports leagues require players to obtain and carry registration cards.
The cards are checked by the referee to confirm eligibility to play in the game.
The cards have pictures to allow confirmation of identity.

The problem with the current system is that the cards must be obtained in person with payment.
The card also does not provide any information on suspensions and other disciplinary information.

iCard will allow a player to register on-line providing picture, payment (TBD) and contact information.
The player will see teams and games to play on.
iCard can be accessed by the referee at game time to verify player id and eligibility.
Also the referee can mark disciplinary actions in iCard and the league can mark suspensions.
